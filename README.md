# Project Management on GitHub using Agile Methodology

Agile methodology is a project management methodology that is used to manage software development projects. It is based on the iterative and incremental development of the project. It is a flexible methodology that allows the project to be adapted to the changes that may occur during the development of the project.


## Agile concepts
- Epics
An epic is a large body of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller stories,in our case “issues” in GitHub. Epics often encompass multiple teams, on multiple projects, and can even be tracked on multiple boards.
Epics are almost always delivered over a set of sprints. As a team learns more about an epic through development and customer feedback, user stories will be added and removed as necessary. That’s the key with agile epics: Scope is flexible, based on customer feedback and team cadence
- Stories
A story is a description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. A story is a small unit of work that delivers some value to the customer.
A story can be also broken down to its essential bits using a set of ordered Tasks that will eventually give the completion of the story itself as their final product. In our team we refer to this process as “breaking down a story”.
- Tasks
A task is a small unit of work that can be completed in a short period of time. A task is a concrete step that needs to be done to complete a story. A task is a small unit of work that delivers some value to the customer.
- Sprints
A sprint is a set period of time during which specific work needs to be completed. Sprints are usually two weeks long, but can be longer or shorter depending on the team’s needs. Sprints are used to break down work into smaller, more manageable chunks. The outcome of a Sprint is usually a working piece of software that will be added to the main “trunk” of the project. We can think of it like an single entry in a release changelog. You will probably set a milestone that will eventually represent a new release to be published, and that milestone will be made of several sprints that will add feature over feature to your final product.
- Backlog
    - Sprint Backlog

    Essentially, the backlog is a collection of stories that have to be finished and tested before the end of the Sprint. At the beginning of each Sprint the team will decide which stories have to be pulled out from the Global Backlog. Moreover, the stories that belongs to a Sprint should be ordered by their priority and tagged with a number of points, representing the complexity of the story itself.
    - Global Backlog

    The global backlog is a prioritised list of stories that has not been scheduled to be completed. As new work comes in, it gets added to the global backlog and it possibly gets an assigned priority and maybe a label. In an Agile workflow, the development team pulls from the backlog as opposed to a manager pushing work onto the developers. The goal is to keep the backlog as small and as organized as possible.

## GitHub tools
- Scrum board and Task board
The scrum board is a tool used to track the progress of a project. It is used to display the work that needs to be done, the work that is currently being done, and the work that has been completed.
- Milestones
Millstones are used to group issues into sprints. Milestones collectively manage and track progress on groups of issues and prioritase them. Milestones are issues grouped by a deadline or delivery time.
    - The issues can be the functionalities to be carried out for the next version and can be grouped in a milestone with the number of the next version and the release date.
    - In another structure, the issues can be user stories and tasks and can be grouped in a milestone with the current sprint and with the end date.
- Projects
After adding our epics, stories and tasks we can go to our boards and check that they have been added. In this way, at the beginning of Scrum, we can add all our epics and user stories to our project backlog.
Projects are used to group issues into a project board. Projects are used to track progress on groups of issues and prioritise them. Projects are issues grouped by a project board.

- Issues
Issues are the main element of GitHub. They can be used to track bugs, enhancements, tasks, or even user stories. Issues can be created by anyone (for public repositories), and are moderated by repository collaborators. Each issue contains its own discussion forum, can be assigned to a user, and can be labeled and milestoned.


### Issues and Labels
#### CREATE EPICS, STORIES AND TASKS:
1. Create templates for issues:
Epic, Story, Task
2. Create labels for issues:
EPIC, STORY, TASK
3. Create a project boards:
Scrum board, Task board
4. Create a new issue:
    - For an epic we only need to put the title and description, we do not need to add an assignee or add them to a project.
    - For a story we need to add the title, link to the epic to which it belongs, add the description, acceptance criteria and tasks, assign the person in charge of following up on this user story and add it to the Scrum board.
    - For a task we need to add the title, link to the story to which it belongs, add the description, assign the person in charge of carrying out this task and add it to the task board.

### Milestones
#### CREATE SPRINTS:
1. Create a milestone:
    - Add the title of the sprint
    - Add the description of the sprint
    - Add the due date of the sprint
2. Add the issues to the sprint:
    - Add the issues to the sprint by dragging them from the Scrum board to the sprint milestone. This will automatically add the issues to the sprint milestone.
    - Add the issues to the sprint by adding them to the sprint milestone.


### Projects
#### CREATE SCRUM BOARD AND TASK BOARD::
1. Create a project board:
    - Add the title of the project board
    - Add the description of the project board
    - Add the columns of the project board
2. Add the issues to the project board
