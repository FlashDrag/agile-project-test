# Project Management on GitHub using Agile Methodology

Agile methodology is a project management methodology that is used to manage software development projects. It is based on the iterative and incremental development of the project. It is a flexible methodology that allows the project to be adapted to the changes that may occur during the development of the project.

## Issues and Labels
### CREATE EPICS, STORIES AND TASKS:
1. Create templates for issues:
Epic, Story, Task
2. Create labels for issues:
EPIC, STORY, TASK
3. Create a project boards:
Scrum board, Task board
4. Create a new issue:
    - For an epic we only need to put the title and description, we do not need to add an assignee or add them to a project.
    - For a story we need to add the title, link to the epic to which it belongs, add the description, acceptance criteria and tasks, assign the person in charge of following up on this user story and add it to the Scrum board.
    - For a task we need to add the title, link to the story to which it belongs, add the description, assign the person in charge of carrying out this task and add it to the task board.

## Milestones
Millstones are used to group issues into sprints. Milestones collectively manage and track progress on groups of issues and prioritase them. Milestones are issues grouped by a deadline or delivery time.

- The issues can be the functionalities to be carried out for the next version and can be grouped in a milestone with the number of the next version and the release date.
- In another structure, the issues can be user stories and tasks and can be grouped in a milestone with the current sprint and with the end date.

### CREATE SPRINTS:
1. Create a milestone:
    - Add the title of the sprint
    - Add the description of the sprint
    - Add the due date of the sprint
2. Add the issues to the sprint:
    - Add the issues to the sprint by dragging them from the Scrum board to the sprint milestone. This will automatically add the issues to the sprint milestone.
    - Add the issues to the sprint by adding them to the sprint milestone.


## Projects
After adding our epics, stories and tasks we can go to our boards and check that they have been added. In this way, at the beginning of Scrum, we can add all our epics and user stories to our project backlog.

Projects are used to group issues into a project board. Projects are used to track progress on groups of issues and prioritise them. Projects are issues grouped by a project board.

### CREATE PROJECT BOARDS:
1. Create a project board:
    - Add the title of the project board
    - Add the description of the project board
    - Add the columns of the project board
2. Add the issues to the project board
